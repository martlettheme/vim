# Martlet for Vim and Neovim

## Install

For Vim's native package loader:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/martlettheme/vim.git ~/.vim/pack/themes/start/martlet
```

For Neovim's native package loader:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/martlettheme/vim.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/themes/start/martlet
```

Or add `martlettheme/vim` to your plugin manager. The root `colors/` layout supports both editors.

```vim
set termguicolors
set background=dark
colorscheme martlet
```

Choose Light with `set background=light` before `colorscheme martlet`. Explicit names `martlet-light` and `martlet-dark` also work. Neovim Lua: `vim.cmd.colorscheme('martlet-dark')`. GUI/truecolor uses the exact canonical hex colors; 256-color terminals use nearest xterm approximations. Standard syntax, editor chrome, diffs, diagnostics, and Neovim Treesitter/LSP capture links are included. Requires Vim 8+ or Neovim 0.9+; exact capture coverage depends on parser/plugin versions.

For a manual installation, copy all three files from `colors/` into your editor's colors directory. Run tests with full Vim and Neovim installed.

These are generated distributions of [Martlet Theme](https://martlettheme.dev/), version 1.0.0. Canonical colors and generators live in [martlettheme/martlettheme](https://github.com/martlettheme/martlettheme). The source repository may require maintainer access. This repository includes a complete color snapshot in source.json and can build without access to that repository.

## Maintenance

Edit the canonical palette and generator upstream, then run npm run build there. The complete distribution directories are emitted under artifacts/repositories/. Sync the relevant directory into this repository. To reproduce a snapshot here, run npm run build, then npm test. Node.js 22 or newer is used in CI. No registry publication runs automatically.
